Im a radioactive chemical element with the symbol Pu and atomic number 94!
the plutonium username was reserved by someone else so i take this instead.
its better anyway :/ so im a developer of most things. some times i need to config a linux server and its network so i become a devOps,
become a AI and IOT developer by making robots for fun or festivals.
making web sites or creating apps with .net core are other jobs i do. but mainly i develop games and create 3d arts.

you can contact me by my discord server.
